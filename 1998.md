In 1998 (Hebrew year 5758), Israel marked its **50th anniversary** — a symbolic **jubilee year**, evoking the biblical theme of return, freedom, and restoration. Many saw this as a turning point: the Jewish people had physically returned to their land, built a stable state, and secured national strength. In prophetic terms, it was as if **“the bones had gathered”** — referencing Ezekiel’s vision of dry bones (Ezekiel 37) — where the physical body of the nation is reassembled, but the **spirit has not yet entered**.

This moment in history, then, is seen by some as the **beginning of the Geulah (redemption)** — not through dramatic miracles or messianic revelation, but through a quiet, foundational shift. The land was ready, the people were gathered, and the structures were in place — yet the full spiritual awakening, the breath of divine purpose, was still to come. 1998 was the **threshold**, where redemption began to take shape — outwardly complete, inwardly waiting for spirit.
