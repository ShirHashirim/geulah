                <h2>The Beginning of Geulah</h2>
                
                <div class="two-column">
                    <div class="column">
                        <p>By revealing that <strong>Geulah of Israel</strong> began (beginning of the calendar year 1998), God revealed that it will not spread to all the people at the same time. The aim of God is to first prepare a small herd of pioneers responding to his call. These pioneers have been named <strong>first-fruits</strong> and are expected to be columns of <strong>Geulah of Israel</strong>. In this phase we find ourselves today.</p>
                        
                        <p>The publication of these first-fruits of the tree in Israel is one of the most tangible evidence of the beginning of <strong>Geulah</strong>, the harbinger that the celestial rain will be poured abundantly on all the people.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Geulah</strong> advance is thus linked to the progress of first-fruits. The difficulties experienced by Israel today are the birth pangs of <strong>Geulah</strong>, namely the birth of his first-fruits.</p>
                        
                        <p>Over the <strong>Geulah</strong> progressing within the people-through to his first-fruits of all evil and corruption hidden exteriorized, particularly in structures of the country. When God will judge that the entire flock of first-fruits, then the <strong>Geulah</strong> be extended to all Israel, in a way that only he knows.</p>
                        
                        <p>When it came to Israel, first-fruits in mind, to accomplish its mission of light to the nations and their first-born and their announce <strong>Geulah</strong>, also in the midst of the judgments they pass through.</p>

                    <h3>Preparation and Purification</h3>
                    <p>The first-fruits of Geulah undergo an intensive process of preparation and purification. They are called to a deeper level of spiritual awareness and commitment, as they will serve as guides and examples for others when the full redemption comes.</p>
                    
                    <p>This preparation involves letting go of old patterns, healing from past wounds, and aligning more fully with divine will. It is a challenging but transformative process that prepares them for their role in the broader redemption.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Bearing Witness</h3>
                    <p>The first-fruits bear witness to the reality of Geulah in their own lives. Through their transformation and the fruits of their spiritual journey, they demonstrate the possibility and the path of redemption for others.</p>
                    
                    <p>Their testimony is not primarily in words but in the quality of their being and the nature of their presence. They embody the values and consciousness of the redeemed life, serving as living examples of what is possible.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Building Bridges</h3>
                    <p>The first-fruits serve as bridges between the old consciousness and the new, between the world as it has been and the world as it is becoming. They help others navigate the transition to a more spiritually aligned way of being.</p>
                    
                    <p>This bridge-building function is essential for the smooth unfolding of the redemptive process, as it helps minimize resistance and confusion during times of profound change.</p>
